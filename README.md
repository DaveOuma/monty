Implementing an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files in C. Let's break it down step by step.

Setting up the Project:

Create a folder for your project.
Use vi, vim, or emacs to create your C files. Make sure to follow the specified naming conventions.
Initialize a README.md file.
Data Structures:

Define the required data structures (stack_t and instruction_t) in your header file monty.h.
Include guard your header file.
Interpreter Functions:

Implement the monty program that reads and interprets Monty byte code files.
Check for the correct usage and print error messages accordingly.
Open the file and handle errors if the file can't be opened.
Read the file line by line and parse instructions.
Execute the instructions using the provided data structures.
Memory Management:

Handle dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free the allocated memory using free.
Print an error message and exit if malloc fails.
Coding Style:

Ensure that your code follows the Betty style guidelines. Use betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl for style checks.
Compilation:

Compile your code using the specified options: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
Testing:

Create a set of tests to ensure your interpreter works correctly. Test various instructions and edge cases.
README:

Provide a detailed README.md file with information about your project, how to compile it, and any other relevant details.
Push to GitHub:

Push your code to a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.
Collaboration:

Work together on a set of tests and address any issues collaboratively.
